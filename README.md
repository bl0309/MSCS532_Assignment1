# MSCS532_Assignment1

## Description
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm that sorts a list of numbers in **monotonically decreasing order**.

The project is part of the coursework for MSCS 532 and demonstrates understanding of algorithm implementation and version control using Git.

## Files
- `insertion_sort.py`: Contains the implementation of the insertion sort algorithm and a sample run.
- `README.md`: This file.

## How It Works
The algorithm iterates through the list and inserts each element into its correct position in a sorted (descending) portion of the list.

## Example

Input:
```python
[5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]

Output:
```python
[9, 6, 5, 5, 2, 1]
